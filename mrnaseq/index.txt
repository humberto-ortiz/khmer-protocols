A copy of:

The Eel Pond mRNAseq Protocol
=====================

:author: C. Titus Brown, Camille Scott, and Leigh Sheneman.

modified for use with local resources at the University of Puerto Rico
by Humberto Ortiz-Zuazaga.

This is a lightweight protocol for assembling up to a few hundred
million mRNAseq reads, annotating the resulting assembly, and doing
differential expression with RSEM.  It is part of khmer-protocols; see
`the main page for this version <../index.html>`__ for citation
information, and `the khmer-protocols site
<http://khmer-protocols.readthedocs.org/>`__ for the latest released
version.

Special thanks to Dr. Joshua Rosenthal for his help in developing this,
and to Dr. Leslie Babonis for her feedback on various problems!
