0. Downloading and Saving Your Initial Data
===========================================

We're going to run transcriptome assembly on the UPR HPCf cluster
called boqueron
because that way (a) you don't need to buy a big computer, and (b)
I don't have to figure out all the special details of your own
computer system.

This does mean that the first thing you need to do is get yourself and
your data
over to boqueron.  I tend to just store it there in the first place,
because...

The basics
----------

... It's a pain to move your data around. Every system has a special
program for managing your data. Contact the helpdesk if you need
assitance moving your data on or off boqueron.

Logging in to boqueron
-------------------

To login remotely to boqueron you need an ssh client. An example is
`putty`, a secure version of the `puttytel` program you use for
registering courses in UPR.

The HPCf website has a brief primer on `logging in to boqueron
<https://www.hpcf.upr.edu/documentation/boqueron/#ffs-tabbed-11>`__.

Using curl to copy files
------------------

You can also use ``curl`` to download files one at a time from Web or FTP sites.
For example, to save a file from a website, you could use::

   cd $WORK
   curl -O http://path/to/file/on/website

Once you have the files, figure out their size using ``du -sh`` (e.g. after the
above, ``du -sh $WORK`` will tell you how much data you have saved under /work).

Any files in the '/work' directory may be lost if the filesystem
crashes. However, files stored in the '/home', directory will remain
available and are backed up.

More information on the '/home' and '/work' filesystems is available
at `the HPCf website <https://www.hpcf.upr.edu/documentation/boqueron/#ffs-tabbed-13>`__.

Some test data
--------------

To get started with multi-file analysis and assembly, I've provided some
test mRNAseq data from embryonic stages of *Nematostella vectensis*;
the source is `this excellent paper
<http://www.evodevojournal.com/content/4/1/16>`__ by Tulin et al., "A
quantitative reference transcriptome for Nematostella vectensis".
Make a directory to hold the data::

  cd $WORK
  curl -O https://s3.amazonaws.com/public.ged.msu.edu/mrnaseq-subset.tar
  mkdir data
  cd data
  tar xvf ../mrnaseq-subset.tar

Additional information
----------------------

Throughout this protocol we will be using commandline interfaces. There
is a short document explaining the notations used here. (see
:doc:`../docs/command-line`). The command line we use is bash, an
interface used in UNIX and linux. As you work more in bioinformatics,
you will eventually need to find a UNIX/linux tutorial, and perhaps a
bash scripting tutorial.
